## Self Evaluation Card

Spend a few minutes every day thinking about how you're doing with the weeks
learning objectives:

1. Copy and paste this score card into your `boots/your-name.md` file
2. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
3. Add a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.

This was a really hard day. It was very satisfying to get a working app up to Heroku, even though it was very small and I don't know if I could replicate the process on my own. I learned a little bit of: RSpec, Capybara, Heroku, Git, MERGE CONFLICTS, and the four rules of Simple design.
