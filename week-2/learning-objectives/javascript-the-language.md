# Javascript the Language

Javascript is a programming language. It's actually a pretty simple one, though
it's kind of hard.

## :+1:
1. I can define variables that contain Strings, Numbers, functions and object
   literals
1. I am comfortable passing functions as arguments to other functions
1. I use the `var` keyword to prevent variables from entering the global scope
1. I can iterate over arrays and objects
1. I can use [objects literals](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/javascript-foundations/objects/basic-objects) as key-value pairs
1. I reference the [documentation for
   javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
   frequently

## :+1: :+1:
1. I group similar javascript functions into objects
1. I write functions which take functions as an argument
1. I use the [module
   pattern](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html)
   to keep my functions and variables out of the global scope
1. I can use prototypes and the new keyword
1. I can accurately trace what [this](http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=Understanding_JavaScript%27s_this_keyword) will be in most instances
1. I can mix in objects into my objects prototypes to add behavior

## :+1: :+1: :+1:
1. I write functions that return functions when appropriate
1. I can write my own modules to mix into other objects
1. I can use  [call and
   apply](http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=JavaScript_call_and_apply) to
   change `this` for given objects
